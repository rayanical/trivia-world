# üöÄ Trivia World: Real-Time Multiplayer Trivia Platform  

*Trivia World* is a fast, full-stack trivia app built to show real skill in handling **real-time systems**, **scalable cloud architecture**, and **secure, smooth user experiences**. The whole thing was made to prove that I can build something reliable, quick, and data-driven ‚Äî the kind of app that actually holds up under pressure.

## ‚ú® What Makes It Tick  

This app pulls together a modern stack and pushes it pretty far.  

### 1. Real-Time Gameplay (Socket.IO + Node.js)  

* **Instant Game Sync:** I built a custom Node.js and Express backend (`server.ts`) that uses **Socket.IO** to keep every player‚Äôs screen perfectly in sync ‚Äî every tap, every answer, updated in real time with almost no delay.  

* **Smart Game Flow:** The logic runs like a state machine ‚Äî clean and predictable. From creating a lobby (`create-game`) to players joining (`join-game`), sending questions, and checking answers the moment everyone locks in, it all just flows.  

* **Stay Connected:** Players can drop out and jump back in without losing progress. And if the host disconnects, another player automatically takes over. No broken games, no frustration.  

* **Performance First:** Core game data lives in an in-memory dictionary (`games: Record<string, Game>`), which keeps everything lightning fast by skipping unnecessary database calls.  

### 2. Secure Backend + Data Layer (Supabase)  

* **Authentication That Just Works:** Used **Supabase Auth** for simple email/password signups and quick **Google OAuth 2.0** logins ‚Äî secure and modern.  

* **Data You Can Trust:** Player stats and scores are updated through PostgreSQL **RPC** calls (`update_solo_stats`, `update_multiplayer_game_stats`), which means every update is handled safely and consistently.  

* **Avatar Uploads, Done Right:** Built a smooth system for players to upload and manage avatars with client-side compression, **Supabase Storage**, and cleanup logic for unused files ‚Äî so it stays tidy behind the scenes.  

### 3. Smooth Frontend & User Experience (Next.js 15 + React 19)  

* **Modern React Setup:** Everything runs on the **Next.js App Router** and **React 19**, with hooks like `useAuth` and `useAlert`, plus smart code-splitting for speed.  

* **Player Stats Dashboard:** There‚Äôs a full profile page (`src/app/profile/page.tsx`) that actually shows something useful ‚Äî accuracy by difficulty, win/loss ratios, and more. It‚Äôs all there to keep players hooked.  

* **Looks Good Everywhere:** Styled with **Tailwind CSS 4**, so the app fits cleanly on any screen ‚Äî big, small, or in-between ‚Äî without breaking the layout.
